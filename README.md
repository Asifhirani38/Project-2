### This is a read me file for Project 2 of my bootcamp program at Code Institute in partnership with West Minster Adult Education Service, London.

In this project, I have built image carousel using HTML, CSS and JS.

I plan to use this carousel component in a website for Cycling in London project. 

I have used Javascript to add interactivity on the image carousel so that the visitor of the website can scroll left and right to view different images.
